Summary of Loss Functions
Loss Function###########Purpose################################ Use Case
    
L1 Loss	-> Less sensitive to outliers, sharper output ->	General fine-tuning

Spectral Loss -->	Matches frequency domain features -->	Audio tasks, vocal isolation

Perceptual Loss -->	High-level perceptual similarity -->	Human-like audio quality

Multi-Scale Loss -->	Multi-resolution accuracy -->	Captures fine details

STFT Loss -->	Preserves time-frequency alignment -->	Audio reconstruction tasks

Hybrid Loss -->	Combines multiple losses -->	Best for balancing multiple aspects
